# Visual-Echo
Spatialisation of Reservoir computing networks for display and efficiency purposes.

## The objective
During this project, I will try to spatialize the reservoir of an Echo-State Network for display purposes, but also to take into account the layout of the human brain. I will additionally try to get interesting properties from this network.

## What was done:

* :ballot_box_with_check: Implementation of a basic ESN:
The first step was an implementation of an Echo State Network, in this case to predict Mackey-Glass' series.
It led to an ESN object, with some basic functions and methods. 

* :ballot_box_with_check: A basic display:
The next part consisted in displaying this network, here simply by making it into a squared image, and showing the evolution of the activation.

* :soon: The spatialized ESN:
This leads to the main part of the project: to give the neurons a position in the plan, before trying to use different properties and see how it learns.
This is currently undergoing.

## How to use it:
TODO


## What is left todo:
* :soon: Switch to a prediction of the sinus function.
* :soon: Properly use the spatialisation
* :soon: Update the display function, and check wether it is working properly.
* :soon: Introduce different types of neurons (having different connecting behaviours)
* :soon: Test different properties on the connectivity of the neurons
* :soon: Try to use Voronoi Tesselation for display purpose.
