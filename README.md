# Visual-Echo
Spatialisation of Reservoir computing networks for display purposes.

## The objective
By using computer graphics methods, I will try to spatialize the reservoir of an Echo-State Network for display purposes, but also to take into account the layout of the human brain. I will additionally try to get interesting properties from this network.

## What was done:

###Implementation of a basic ESN:
The first step was an implementation of an Echo State Network, in this case to predict Mackey-Glass' series.
It led to an ESN object, with some basic functions and methods. 

###A basic display:
The next part consisted in displaying this network, here simply by making it into a squared image, and showing the evolution of the activation.

###The spatialized ESN:
This leads to the main part of the project: to give the neurons a position in the plan, before trying to use different properties and see how it learns.
This is currently undergoing.

##How to use:
